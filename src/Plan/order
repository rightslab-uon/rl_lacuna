2. processing

b) scatter graphs (compare variables)
c) descriptive stats (with time split)
d) dispersion graphs (different pollutants on x, different locations on x with the same pollutant - all data by date and descriptive stats)
d) line graphs (no time split)
e) line graphs (with time split - start to end on x, line per time period)
f) box and whisker plots - means by hour with sd
